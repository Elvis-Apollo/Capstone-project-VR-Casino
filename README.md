# 4ZP6A/B Capstone - VR Research Casino

### Project Description
The goal of the project is a virtual reality casino which will be used to model human behaviour based on financial risk. We will develop mini-games, such as a slot machine, to model how financial risk affects human behaviour. The purpose of the project is that by allowing changes in the environment, such as placement of objects and providing feedback to the user, the researchers will be able to observe how human behaviour changes based off changes in the environment. These possible changes in the environment will be controlled by the researchers. It will work by using unity to create the models required for the environment and coding will be done in c sharp. The special aspects of it are that by allowing the researchers to decide what will be changeable/usable they can model how small changes in the experience affect the behaviour of individuals and how they go by taking financial risk. It is basically a tool that lets us see how people behave based off certain situations and criteria.
